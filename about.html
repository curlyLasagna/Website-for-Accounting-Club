   excerpt: "My name is Renzo. I was born in the Philippines but grew up in Middle River, Maryland.
   I am currently a junior accounting student at The University of Southern Mississippi
    and work part-time as an accounting assistant for Schamber Jones CPA.
    Before I became a student of accountancy, I served five years in the United States Marine Corps as a Small Arms Repair/Technician.
    During my five years in the United States Marine Corps, I was able to experience the diverse cultures of Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and many more.
    Through hard work and dedication, I eventually became an Armory Chief, Hazardous Materials/Waste Coordinator, and a Readiness Deployment Inspector. Working in these three leadership positions, I discovered my passion for accounting. With my experience and leadership, I hope to revitalize the accounting society and improve the overall community of the USM Gulf Park Campus. I look forward to working with all of you to bring positive changes to the year 2023!"
